# easy-git

CLI package with simplified aliases for git commands.

_In progress..._

-----

## my jottings

to move changes from one branch to another

> cut/copy changes (which is current branch) to branch-name

create branch from new changes

> create branch branch-name with changes

one test should be that all keys in commands should be an object with key, git. If defined key does not exist as a child to git, ensure that the key in command is the same as git

one issue, git colors are hidden in stdout
